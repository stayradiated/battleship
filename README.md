## Controls

- **q**: quit
- **up,down,left,right**: move cursor
- **space**: fire

## Things to improve

- Clean up the map by using clearly identifiable characters to represent ships,
    hits and misses.
- Count the number of moves, track sunk ships and add a win state.
- Improve the 'AI' so it's not just randomly picking coordinates. [This is
    a really great write up on how it should
    work](http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/).
